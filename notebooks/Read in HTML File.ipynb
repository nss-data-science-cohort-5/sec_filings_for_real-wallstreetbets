      "\n",
      "\n",
      "56\n",
      "Our assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern was dependent on many factors, including, among other things, whether we would be able to maintain a Demotech rating of “A” for FNIC and MNIC, the impact such a downgrade might have on our ability to obtain excess-of-loss reinsurance for the period beginning July 1, 2022, and the continued impact severe weather events in 2022 will have on our RBC ratio and statutory surplus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "57\n",
      "The Company reached this conclusion based on its expectation of continued underwriting losses in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of new catastrophe weather events occurring late in the first quarter and, more importantly, based on Demotech’s downgrade of FNIC’s rating from “A” to “S”.\n",

      "\n",
      "60\n",
      "Absent such coverage, the Company will not be in compliance with requirements communicated by the Office of Insurance Regulation of the state of Florida (“OIR”) regarding such coverage, which could ultimately result in the Company being placed into receivership.\n",

      "61\n",

      "On April 21, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the OIR under which the Company has agreed to file with the OIR by April 29, 2022 a plan to demonstrate the Company’s ability to secure and maintain a financial strength rating acceptable to the secondary mortgage market, acquire sufficient reinsurance as of its July 1, 2022 renewal, support its existing business via the securing of additional capital, and address its non-Florida losses and policies.\n",
